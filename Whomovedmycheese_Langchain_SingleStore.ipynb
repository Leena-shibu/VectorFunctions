They wanted to hear more about what was happening in each other's lives. After a good deal of kidding, and a good meal, they settled into an interesting conversation.\n\nAngela, who had been one of the most popular people in the class, said, \"Life sure turned out differently than I thought it would when we were in school. A lot has changed.\"\n\n\"It certainly has,\" Nathan echoed. They knew he had gone into his family's business, which had operated pretty much the same and had been a part of the local community for as long as they could remember. So, they were surprised when he seemed concerned. He asked, \"But, have you noticed how we don't want to change when things change?\"\n\nCarlos said, \"I guess we resist changing, because we're afraid of change.\"\n\n\"Carlos, you were Captain of the football team\" Jessica said. \"I never thought I'd hear you say anything about being afraid!\"\n\nThey all laughed as they realized that although they had gone off in different directions—from working at home to managing companies—they were experiencing similar feelings.\n\nEveryone was trying to cope with the unexpected changes that were happening to them in recent years. And most admitted that they did not know a good way to handle them.\n\nThen Michael said, \"I used to be afraid of change. When a big change came along in our business, we didn't know what to do. So we didn't adjust and we almost lost it.\n"}],"source":"query_text = \"How can we adapt to changes early? \"\n\ndocs = docsearch.similarity_search(query_text)\n\nprint(docs[0].page_content)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":125,"id":"fcf37190-7e8a-4451-b124-ecdd9a7a1e43","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-22T05:35:23.708379Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-22T05:35:23.708126Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-22T05:35:42.084655Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-22T05:35:42.084081Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-22T05:35:23.708361Z"},"language":"python","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Adapting to changes early involves a few key strategies as suggested by the text. You can be like 'Sniff' who is always vigilant and identifies changes early on. This might involve staying up to date in your field or always being open to new information. Alternatively, you can be like 'Scurry' who acts swiftly when a change is noticed. This entails acting promptly when a change is detected instead of procrastinating or ignoring it.\n\nAnother perspective is to avoid being like 'Hem' who resists change out of fear. Resistance to change can lead to stagnation and missed opportunities. On the other hand, it can be beneficial to be like 'Haw' who adapts when he realizes that change could lead to better things. This involves having an optimistic outlook on change as a way of fostering personal or professional growth. \n\nAnother important aspect of handling change is overcoming fear. Carlos, a former classmate in the story, admitted they feared change. Everyone, despite their varied career paths, experienced similar feelings of unease with unexpected changes. The ability to cope well with change involves acknowledging these fears without allowing them to be hindrances. It's important to remember that experiencing fear is natural, and overcoming it requires practice and patience.\n\nMoreover, you need to understand the implications of not adapting to change. In the case of Michael’s business, failure to adapt almost led to their loss. This can motivate you to act quickly when future changes occur. To adapt to changes early, you should be proactive, embrace learning, be ready to change your old ways, and see change as an opportunity rather than a threat.\n"}],"source":"import openai\n\nprompt = f\"The user asked: {query_text}.
