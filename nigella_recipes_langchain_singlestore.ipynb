Reduce the amaretti biscuits to rubble in the processor and, reserving some crumbs for sprinkling over the top at the end, scatter most of them evenly over the sponges and then pour over them 150ml / two-thirds cup of the limoncello.\\nPut the remaining 50g / one-third cup of jam into a wide saucepan with the lemon juice and melt over a low heat, then tumble in the blackberries and turn in the heat for a minute or so just until the juices start running. Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sponge sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.\\nWhisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick smooth yellow paste. I use my Kitchen Aid for this, but any old hand-held electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another 50ml / 3 tablespoons limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining 50ml / 3 tablespoons of limoncello.\\nFinally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.\\nCover the thus-far assembled trifle with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for the flavours and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the fridge for about 40 minutes to an hour before it's needed (depending on how cold your fridge runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a dry, oil-less pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them on to a plate. When they're cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the clingfilm from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berrieness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch.\", metadata={'source': './recipes.txt'}),\n Document(page_content=\"METHOD\\nHeat the milk in a pan, and while it's getting warm, beat together the sugar, Philadelphia, vanilla and egg in a bowl. Still whisking, pour the hot milk into the cream cheese mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan and cook till a velvety custard. I don't bother with a double boiler, and actually don't even keep the heat very low, but you will need to stir it constantly, and if you think there's any trouble ahead, plunge the pan into a sink half filled with cold water and whisk like mad. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, this way, for the custard to cook. And when it has thickened, take it off the heat, pour into a bowl and let it cool, at which time add the lemon juice and then the double cream, lightly whipped.\\nFreeze in an ice cream maker or place into a covered container, stick it in the freezer and whip it out every hour for 3 hours as it freezes and give it a good beating, folding in the crushed digestives — if using — before the ice cream is set solid.\", metadata={'source': './recipes.txt'}),\n Document(page_content=\"METHOD\\nPut a pie dish of about 20cm / 8 inches diameter in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it's about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I'm not saying it will — with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough — but I always feel better if I've done this.\\nPut the cream and vanilla pod into a saucepan and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and caster sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavoured cream over it, pod and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you're scared) until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes should do it. You do want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.\\nWhen the cream's thick enough, take out the vanilla pod, retrieve the pie dish and pour this creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.\\nPut back in the fridge if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving.

egg based recipes are used\n\n**Answer**:Some of the egg-based recipes mentioned are:\n\n1. Anglo-Italian Trifle: This dessert uses two large eggs separated. The egg yolks are whisked with caster sugar to create a thick smooth yellow paste, then combined with mascarpone cheese after whisking in limoncello.\n\n2. Creme Brulee: This recipe calls for 8 large egg yolks which are beaten together with caster sugar. The mixture is then combined with heated cream and vanilla and cooked until it thickens into a custard.\n\n3. An unnamed dessert recipe where the sugar, Philadelphia cheese, vanilla, and egg are beaten together in a bowl. This is then combined with hot milk to create a velvety custard which is then cooled and mixed with lemon juice and lightly whipped double cream. The mixture is frozen and beaten every hour for 3 hours until it sets into ice cream.\n\n->**Question**:Give one recipe on puddingI have biscuits with me,suggest a recipe?\n\n**Answer**:Sure, you can make a Cherry Cheesecake that uses biscuits. Here is the recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n- 125 grams crumbled digestive biscuits\n- 75 grams soft butter\n- 300 grams cream cheese\n- 60 grams icing sugar\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- ½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n- 250 millilitres double cream\n- 1 x 284 grams jar black cherry spread (e.g., St Dalfour Rhapsodie de Fruit)\n\nMethod:\n1. Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until beginning to turn to crumbs, then add the butter and whiz again to make the mixture clump.\n2. Press this mixture into a 20cm / 8 inch springform tin; press a little up the sides to form a slight ridge.\n3. Beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice in a bowl until smooth.\n4. Lightly whip the double cream, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture.\n5. Spoon the cheesecake filling on top of the biscuit base and smooth with a spatula. Put it in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight.\n6. When you are ready to serve the cheesecake, unmould it and spread the black cherry over the top.\n\n"}],"source":"questions=[\n    \"Which egg based recipes are used\",\n    \"Give one recipe on

Still whisking, pour the hot milk into the cream cheese mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan and cook till a velvety custard. I don't bother with a double boiler, and actually don't even keep the heat very low, but you will need to stir it constantly, and if you think there's any trouble ahead, plunge the pan into a sink half filled with cold water and whisk like mad. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, this way, for the custard to cook. And when it has thickened, take it off the heat, pour into a bowl and let it cool, at which time add the lemon juice and then the double cream, lightly whipped.<br>Freeze in an ice cream maker or place into a covered container, stick it in the freezer and whip it out every hour for 3 hours as it freezes and give it a good beating, folding in the crushed digestives — if using — before the ice cream is set solid.</td>\n            <td>0.5066952109336853</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>METRICCUPS<br>8 trifle sponges<br>200 grams blackcurrant jam<br>200 grams amaretti biscuits<br>250 millilitres limoncello or other lemon liqueur<br>juice of ½ lemon<br>750 grams blackberries<br>2 large eggs (separated)<br>100 grams caster sugar<br>750 grams mascarpone cheese<br>50 grams flaked almonds<br>METHOD<br>Split the trifle sponges and make little sandwiches of them using 150g / two-thirds cup of the jam, then wodge them into the base of your glass bowl. Reduce the amaretti biscuits to rubble in the processor and, reserving some crumbs for sprinkling over the top at the end, scatter most of them evenly over the sponges and then pour over them 150ml / two-thirds cup of the limoncello.<br>Put the remaining 50g / one-third cup of jam into a wide saucepan with the lemon juice and melt over a low heat, then tumble in the blackberries and turn in the heat for a minute or so just until the juices start running. Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sponge sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.<br>Whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick smooth yellow paste. I use my Kitchen Aid for this, but any old hand-held electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another 50ml / 3 tablespoons limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining 50ml / 3 tablespoons of limoncello.<br>Finally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.<br>Cover the thus-far assembled trifle with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for the flavours and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the fridge for about 40 minutes to an hour before it's needed (depending on how cold your fridge runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a dry, oil-less pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them on to a plate. When they're cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the clingfilm from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berrieness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch.</td>\n            <td>0.504974365234375</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>CHERRY CHEESECAKE<br>INGREDIENTS<br>Serves: 6-8</td>\n            <td>0.4969905614852905</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>METRICCUPS<br>125 grams crumbled digestive biscuits<br>75 grams soft butter<br>300 grams cream cheese<br>60 grams icing sugar<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br>250 millilitres double cream<br>1 x 284 grams jar black cherry spread (e.g., St Dalfour Rhapsodie de Fruit)<br>METHOD<br>Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until beginning to turn to crumbs, then add the butter and whiz again to make the mixture clump.<br>Press this mixture into a 20cm / 8 inch springform tin; press a little up the sides to form a slight ridge.<br>Beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice in a bowl until smooth.<br>Lightly whip the double cream, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture.<br>Spoon the cheesecake filling on top of the biscuit base and smooth with a spatula.

Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it's about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I'm not saying it will — with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough — but I always feel better if I've done this.<br>Put the cream and vanilla pod into a saucepan and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and caster sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavoured cream over it, pod and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you're scared) until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes should do it. You do want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.<br>When the cream's thick enough, take out the vanilla pod, retrieve the pie dish and pour this creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.<br>Put back in the fridge if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving. At which stage, put the bowl on the table and, with a large spoon and unchecked greed, crack through the sugary carapace and delve into the satin-velvet, vanilla-speckled cream beneath.

vanilla and egg in a bowl. Still whisking, pour the hot milk into the cream cheese mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan and cook till a velvety custard. I don't bother with a double boiler, and actually don't even keep the heat very low, but you will need to stir it constantly, and if you think there's any trouble ahead, plunge the pan into a sink half filled with cold water and whisk like mad. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, this way, for the custard to cook. And when it has thickened, take it off the heat, pour into a bowl and let it cool, at which time add the lemon juice and then the double cream, lightly whipped.

maker or place into a covered container, stick it in the freezer and whip it out every hour for 3 hours as it freezes and give it a good beating, folding in the crushed digestives — if using — before the ice cream is set solid.

the jam, then wodge them into the base of your glass bowl. Reduce the amaretti biscuits to rubble in the processor and, reserving some crumbs for sprinkling over the top at the end, scatter most of them evenly over the sponges and then pour over them 150ml / two-thirds cup of the limoncello.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Put the remaining 50g / one-third cup of jam into a wide saucepan with the lemon juice and melt over a low heat, then tumble in the blackberries and turn in the heat for a minute or so just until the juices start running. Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sponge sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick smooth yellow paste. I use my Kitchen Aid for this, but any old hand-held electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another 50ml / 3 tablespoons limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining 50ml / 3 tablespoons of limoncello.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Finally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                     |\n|                 | Cover the thus-far assembled trifle with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for the flavours and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the fridge for about 40 minutes to an hour before it's needed (depending on how cold your fridge runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a dry, oil-less pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them on to a plate. When they're cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the clingfilm from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berrieness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch. |

Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it's about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I'm not saying it will — with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough — but I always feel better if I've done this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                            Put the cream and vanilla pod into a saucepan and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and caster sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavoured cream over it, pod and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you're scared) until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes should do it. You do want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.                                                                                                                                            |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When the cream's thick enough, take out the vanilla pod, retrieve the pie dish and pour this creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                     |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Put back in the fridge if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving. At which stage, put the bowl on the table and, with a large spoon and unchecked greed, crack through the sugary carapace and delve into the satin-velvet, vanilla-speckled cream beneath.

Still whisking, pour the hot milk into the cream cheese mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan and cook till a velvety custard. I don't bother with a double boiler, and actually don't even keep the heat very low, but you will need to stir it constantly, and if you think there's any trouble ahead, plunge the pan into a sink half filled with cold water and whisk like mad. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, this way, for the custard to cook. And when it has thickened, take it off the heat, pour into a bowl and let it cool, at which time add the lemon juice and then the double cream, lightly whipped.<br>Freeze in an ice cream maker or place into a covered container, stick it in the freezer and whip it out every hour for 3 hours as it freezes and give it a good beating, folding in the crushed digestives — if using — before the ice cream is set solid.</td>\n            <td>0.9932821648068286</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>METRICCUPS<br>8 trifle sponges<br>200 grams blackcurrant jam<br>200 grams amaretti biscuits<br>250 millilitres limoncello or other lemon liqueur<br>juice of ½ lemon<br>750 grams blackberries<br>2 large eggs (separated)<br>100 grams caster sugar<br>750 grams mascarpone cheese<br>50 grams flaked almonds<br>METHOD<br>Split the trifle sponges and make little sandwiches of them using 150g / two-thirds cup of the jam, then wodge them into the base of your glass bowl. Reduce the amaretti biscuits to rubble in the processor and, reserving some crumbs for sprinkling over the top at the end, scatter most of them evenly over the sponges and then pour over them 150ml / two-thirds cup of the limoncello.<br>Put the remaining 50g / one-third cup of jam into a wide saucepan with the lemon juice and melt over a low heat, then tumble in the blackberries and turn in the heat for a minute or so just until the juices start running. Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sponge sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.<br>Whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick smooth yellow paste. I use my Kitchen Aid for this, but any old hand-held electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another 50ml / 3 tablespoons limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining 50ml / 3 tablespoons of limoncello.<br>Finally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.<br>Cover the thus-far assembled trifle with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for the flavours and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the fridge for about 40 minutes to an hour before it's needed (depending on how cold your fridge runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a dry, oil-less pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them on to a plate. When they're cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the clingfilm from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berrieness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch.</td>\n            <td>0.9950132006819056</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>CHERRY CHEESECAKE<br>INGREDIENTS<br>Serves: 6-8</td>\n            <td>1.003004864305318</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>pudding recipes</td>\n            <td>METRICCUPS<br>125 grams crumbled digestive biscuits<br>75 grams soft butter<br>300 grams cream cheese<br>60 grams icing sugar<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br>250 millilitres double cream<br>1 x 284 grams jar black cherry spread (e.g., St Dalfour Rhapsodie de Fruit)<br>METHOD<br>Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until beginning to turn to crumbs, then add the butter and whiz again to make the mixture clump.<br>Press this mixture into a 20cm / 8 inch springform tin; press a little up the sides to form a slight ridge.<br>Beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice in a bowl until smooth.<br>Lightly whip the double cream, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture.<br>Spoon the cheesecake filling on top of the biscuit base and smooth with a spatula.

Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it's about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I'm not saying it will — with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough — but I always feel better if I've done this.<br>Put the cream and vanilla pod into a saucepan and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and caster sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavoured cream over it, pod and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you're scared) until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes should do it. You do want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.<br>When the cream's thick enough, take out the vanilla pod, retrieve the pie dish and pour this creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.<br>Put back in the fridge if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving. At which stage, put the bowl on the table and, with a large spoon and unchecked greed, crack through the sugary carapace and delve into the satin-velvet, vanilla-speckled cream beneath.

bowl. Still whisking, pour the hot milk into the cream cheese mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan and cook till a velvety custard. I don't bother with a double boiler, and actually don't even keep the heat very low, but you will need to stir it constantly, and if you think there's any trouble ahead, plunge the pan into a sink half filled with cold water and whisk like mad. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, this way, for the custard to cook. And when it has thickened, take it off the heat, pour into a bowl and let it cool, at which time add the lemon juice and then the double cream, lightly whipped.

maker or place into a covered container, stick it in the freezer and whip it out every hour for 3 hours as it freezes and give it a good beating, folding in the crushed digestives — if using — before the ice cream is set solid.

then wodge them into the base of your glass bowl.

Tip these over the biscuit-sprinkled, liqueur-soused sponge sandwiches to cover and leave this while you get on with the next bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                    |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick smooth yellow paste. I use my Kitchen Aid for this, but any old hand-held electric mixer or whisk would be fine. Still whisking, drip in another 50ml / 3 tablespoons limoncello and continue whisking away until you have a light moussey mixture. Whisk in the mascarpone until everything is smoothly combined, and when this is done add the remaining 50ml / 3 tablespoons of limoncello.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                    |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Finally, in another bowl, whisk the egg whites until firm, but not dry, and fold these into the lemony, eggy mascarpone mixture. Now spread this gently over the blackberries in the glass bowl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                    |\n|                 | Cover the thus-far assembled trifle with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for the flavours and textures to steep and meld for at least 4 hours and up to 24. Take the trifle out of the fridge for about 40 minutes to an hour before it's needed (depending on how cold your fridge runs) to get to coolish room temperature. Not long before you want to eat, toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a dry, oil-less pan over medium heat until they are turning gold and flashed bronze in parts, then tip them on to a plate. When they're cool, mix them with the reserved amaretti crumbs. Remove the clingfilm from the bowl and scatter the nuts and crumbs over the pale, set surface. Dig in and serve, making sure to heap the full triple-banded layer on each plate: the lemony, almondy, cream-swathed berrieness makes this the perfect ending to a large, lazy summer lunch. |

Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it's about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I'm not saying it will — with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough — but I always feel better if I've done this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                            Put the cream and vanilla pod into a saucepan and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and caster sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavoured cream over it, pod and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you're scared) until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes should do it. You do want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.                                                                                                                                            |                    |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When the cream's thick enough, take out the vanilla pod, retrieve the pie dish and pour this creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                    |\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Put back in the fridge if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving. At which stage, put the bowl on the table and, with a large spoon and unchecked greed, crack through the sugary carapace and delve into the satin-velvet, vanilla-speckled cream beneath.
